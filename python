Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices 
of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

case=1
input=cbaebabacd
abc
output=[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

case=2
input=abab
ab
output=[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
